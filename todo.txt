Add explanatory pictures to readme.md

Prog:
  Smaller todo steps are marked in the beginning and all over program source
  Maybe firmware update over Xmodem? Flash capacity allows this
  _Simple statistics - sectors wrote, sectors read, system uptime, errors
  _Make automated test script for testing backup, restore and file transfer functions
  Add some silly command, for example, C prints out cat on console.
  Add drive number to sector related debug functions
  
Mechanical:
  Fix plastics part width issue
  Assign part numbers to plastic parts
  
Electrical:
  Test with MC1201.01 - NOT BOOTING! Fix issue and test again on other boards.
  Test with real PDP-11 RX01 controller
  
PCB:
  If there will be demand, PCB v 1.1 can be made with fixes:
    LPT signal issue - connect pin2 to GND
    Two component RefDes are swapped
    PCB too wide to fit behind DVK front panel with both connectors soldered
    Maybe remove debug connector and 12b signal
    Edge connector pad length can be reduced, thus making board more narrow
    LPT INV can be controlled from MCU or can be removed at all
      If two XOR IC's are replaced by two invertor IC's, one of 7407's can be removed
