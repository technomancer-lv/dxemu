Add explanatory pictures to readme.md
Add proper Xmodem up/download instructions

Prog:
  Try to solve the restaart issue trying to find if the orphaned INT is the problem
  Smaller todo steps are marked in the beginning and all over program source
  Maybe firmware update over Xmodem? Flash capacity allows this
  _Simple statistics - sectors wrote, sectors read, system uptime, errors
  _Make automated test script for testing backup, restore and file transfer functions
  Add drive number to sector related debug functions
  Programmer out of sync - test on other computers too
  Optimise:
    Make one text output function for strings stored in Flash
  
Mechanical:
  Fix plastics part width issue
  Assign part numbers to plastic parts
  
Electrical:
  Test with real PDP-11 RX01 controller
  
PCB:
  If there will be demand, PCB v 1.1 can be made with fixes:
    LPT signal issue - connect pin2 to GND
    Two component RefDes are swapped
    Maybe remove programming connector
    PCB too wide to fit behind DVK front panel with both connectors soldered
    Maybe remove debug connector and 12b signal
    Edge connector pad length can be reduced, thus making board more narrow
    LPT INV can be controlled from MCU or can be removed at all
      If two XOR IC's are replaced by two invertor IC's, one of 7407's can be removed
    Use smaller components
