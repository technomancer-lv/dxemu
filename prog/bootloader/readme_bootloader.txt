This bootloader is based on Arduino compatible bootloader taken from here:
https://github.com/arduino/ArduinoCore-avr/tree/master/bootloaders/atmega
So all credits for bootloader source and makefile is going to authors mentioned in corresponding page. I made only small modifications, like, different F_CLK and LED on another pin.
